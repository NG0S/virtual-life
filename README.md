virtual-life
============

VirtualLife is a life simulator. 

It does NOT aim to perform a realistic and highly detailled simulation of the natural world. This simulator is rather oriented toward the computation of generations/turns given a virtual environment, some starting individuals/cells and a set of parameters and rules. 

It would allow to reproduce something as simple as Conway's Game of Life, to observe the emergence of ecological behaviors (predatorâ€“prey, mutualism, ...), or even to identify never observed non-natural patterns and behaviors.

## Development

We propose an iterative development with continuous delivery.

This project can be started with the simplest model and the naiviest implementation, to be later improved with additional functionnality, more complex models and computationnaly efficient implementations.

## Programming language

This project will be developped in a high-level programming language like Python3 (+ potentially the PyPy interpreter). Some computationaly intensive parts of the project could also be written in C. However the priority should first be given to the algorithmic optimization rather than the implementation one.
